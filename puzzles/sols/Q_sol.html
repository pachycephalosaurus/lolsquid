This puzzle features a 3x3 grid of seemingly-random objects, with the 7th entry replaced by a question mark. There isn't much to go off of here (except for a 'hint-but-you-don't-know-it-yet' re: the title), so we're best off to start identifying the objects in the puzzle. From top-left to bottom-right, we have:

<br> <br>

<center>
    <table>
		<tbody>
			<tr> <td align = "center">Mars</td> <td align = "center">Albania</td> <td align = "center">astronomy</td>  </tr>
			<tr> <td align = "center">Lech <br> Walesa</td> <td align = "center">Rachel<br> Maddow</td> <td align = "center">666 (number <br> of the beast)</td> </tr>
			<tr> <td align = "center">???</td> <td align = "center">Krypton</td> <td align = "center">Astatine</td>  </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</center>

We notice that the 6th entry is 666, so that might clue us towards something. That fits nicely into the question marks of the title (which is effectively the flavourtext as well), so Q666 is likely to serve as our starting point. 

<br> <br>

A quick Google search for "Q666" (with quotes) brings up the always-unhelpful never-useful raggedy busted horrible stupid Google Gemini AI Overview, informing us that ""Q666" most commonly refers to the ZOMEI Q666 camera tripod." except NO IT FUCKING DOESN'T! A bit of skillful manipulation to our query (mostly to exclude AI slop and contextually approach the "devil number" realm) brings us to the Wikidata page for the <a href = "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q666">number of the beast</a>, which has Wikidata identifier ... [gasp] Q666! Testing this out, we look up Mars and find that it is indeed entry Q111, and Albania is indeed Q222, etc. 

<br> <br>

At this point, all we need to do is find entry Q777 to get our answer!
